Post end of life changes for zf1 to allow compatibility with the latest PHP versions.

If you have any requests for tags, releases, or anything else. Feel free to raise an issue and I'll get it sorted.

Installable through git clone or through `composer require shardj/zf1-future` https://packagist.org/packages/shardj/zf1-future

Recently https://github.com/Shardj/zf1-extras-future has been created for those who need it.
